# -A-Digit-Audio-Recognition-using-FT-and-KNN
A digit recognition model which identifies the spoken digits in an audio file.
Fourier analysis is used to get the energy spectrum of audio signals.
To classify different digits, the K-nearest neighbor algorithm is used in MATLAB.
Accuracy of the model : Training accuracy is 90% and Test accuracy of 80%.
Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, KNN, Fourier Analysis, MATLAB.
